\section{Capturing Inferences Between Atomic Sentences}\label{naturalLanguageInference}

\NI \ELFULL{} arose as an attempt to answer the question: what is the
simplest logic that can capture inferences between atomic sentences of
natural language?  In this section, we enumerate the sorts of
inferences we are trying to capture.  Then we show how \ELABR{}
handles these inferences.  Finally, we compare our approach with the
various attempts at expressing the inferences in first-order logic.

\subsection{Intra-Atomic Inferences in Natural Language}

\NI Natural language admits many types of inference between atomic
sentences.  First, exclusion:
\begin{quote}
``Jack is male'' is incompatible with ``Jack is female''
\end{quote}
Second, entailment inferences from dyadic to monadic predicates:
\begin{quote}
``Jack loves Jill'' implies ``Jack loves''
\end{quote}
Third, adverbial inferences:
\begin{quote}
``Jack walks quickly'' implies ``Jack walks''
\end{quote}
Fourth, inferences from conjunctions of sentences to conjunctions of noun-phrases (and vice-versa):
\begin{quote}
``Jack loves Jill'' and ``Jack loves Joan'' together imply that ``Jack loves Jill and Joan''
\end{quote}
Fifth, inferences from conjunctions of sentences to conjunction of predicates\footnote{See \cite{sommers} p.282 for a spirited defence of predicate conjunction against Fregean regimentation.} (and vice-versa):
\begin{quote}
``Jack is bruised'' and ``Jack is humiliated'' together imply that ``Jack is bruised and humiliated''.
\end{quote}

\NI They all can be handled directly and naturally in \ELABR{}, as we
shall now show.


\subsection{Intra-Atomic Inferences in \ELFULL{}}
%% We shall show that each of the following inferences can be naturally expressed in \ELABR{}:
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item
%% ``Jack is male'' is incompatible with ``Jack is female''
%% \item
%% ``Jack loves Jill'' implies ``Jack loves''\footnote{Although natural languages are full of examples of inferences from dyadic to monadic predicates, there are certain supposed counterexamples to the general rule that a dyadic predicate always implies a monadic one. For example, ``Jack explodes the device'' does not, on its most natural reading, imply that ``Jack explodes''. Our response to cases like this is to distinguish between two distinct monadic predicates $explodes_1$ and $explodes_2$:
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item
%% $X explodes_1$ iff $X$ is an object that undergoes an explosion
%% \item
%% $X explodes_2$ iff $X$ is an agent that initiates an explosion
%% \end{itemize}
%% Now ``Jack explodes the device'' does imply that ``Jack $explodes_2$'' but does not imply that ``Jack $explodes_1$''. 
%% There is no deep problem here - just another case where natural language overloads the same word in different situation to have different meanings.}
%% \item
%% ``Jack walks quickly'' implies ``Jack walks''
%% \item
%% ``Jack loves Jill'' and ``Jack loves Joan'' together imply that ``Jack loves Jill and Joan''
%% \item
%% ``Jack is bruised'' and ``Jack is humiliated'' together imply that ``Jack is bruised and humiliated''.
%% \end{itemize}

Incompatibility such as that between ``Jack is male'' and ``Jack is
female'' is translated into \ELABR{} as the pair of incompatible
sentences:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\MAY{jack} \MAY{sex} (\MAY{male} \land \fBang \{male\}) 
   \qquad\qquad
\MAY{jack} \MAY{sex} (\MAY{female} \land \fBang \{female\})
\end{eqnarray*}

\NI Entailment from dyadic to monadic predicates:
``Jack loves Jill'' is translated into \ELABR{} as:
\begin{eqnarray*}
   \MAY{jack} \MAY{loves} \MAY{jill}
\end{eqnarray*}
The semantics of modalities ensures that this directly entails:
\begin{eqnarray*}
   \MAY{jack} \MAY{loves}
\end{eqnarray*}

\NI Similarly, \ELABR{} supports inferences from triadic to dyadic
predicates:
\begin{quote}
  ``Jack passed the biscuit to Mary'' implies ``Jack passed the biscuit''
\end{quote}

\NI This can be expressed directly in \ELABR{} as:
\[
   \MAY{jack} \MAY{passed} \MAY{biscuit} \MAY{to} (\MAY{mary} \land !\{mary\}) \models \MAY{jack} \MAY{passed} \MAY{biscuit}
\]

\NI Adverbial inferences is captures in eremic logic as follows.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\MAY{jack} \MAY{walks} \MAY{quickly}
\end{eqnarray*}
entails:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\MAY{jack} \MAY{walks}
\end{eqnarray*}

\NI \ELABR{} directly supports inferences from conjunctions of
sentences to conjunctions of noun-phrases.  As our models are
deterministic, we have the general rule that $ \MAY{a} \MAY{b} \land
\MAY{a} \MAY{c} \models \MAY{a} (\MAY{b} \land \MAY{c})$ from which
it follows that
\begin{eqnarray*}
   \MAY{jack} \MAY{loves} \MAY{jill}
      \qquad\text{and}\qquad
   \MAY{jack} \MAY{loves} \MAY{joan}
\end{eqnarray*}
together imply
\begin{eqnarray*}
\MAY{jack} \MAY{loves} (\MAY{jill} \land \MAY{joan})
\end{eqnarray*}

\NI Using the same rule, we can infer that
\begin{eqnarray*}
   \MAY{jack} \MAY{bruised} \land \MAY{jack} \MAY{humiliated}
\end{eqnarray*}

\NI together imply
\begin{eqnarray*}
\MAY{jack} (\MAY{bruised} \land \MAY{humiliated})
\end{eqnarray*}
 
\subsection{Representing incompatible predicates in \FOL}\label{incompatiblepredicatesinfol}

\NI How are incompatible predicates represented in traditional
\fol?  Brachman and Levesque\cite{brachman} introduce the
topic of incompatible predicates by remarking:
\begin{quote}
   We would consider it quite ``obvious'' in this domain that if it
   were asserted that $John$ were a $Man$, then we should answer
   ``no'' to the query $Woman(John)$.
\end{quote}

\NI They propose adding an extra axiom to express the incompatibility:
\[
   \forall x. ( Man(x) \rightarrow \neg Woman(x) )
\]  
 
\NI This proposal imposes an authoring burden on the
knowledge-representer.  We would have to add an extra axiom for every
pair of incompatible predicates.  This proposal becomes particularly
burdensome when dealing with large sets of incompatible predicates.
For example, suppose there are 50 football teams, and a person can
only support one team at a time.  We would need to add $C \cdot {50 \choose 2}$
axioms: incompatibility axioms would become large and unwieldy:
\[
\begin{array}{l}
  \forall x.  \neg (SupportsArsenal(x) \land SupportsLiverpool(x))  \\
  \forall x.  \neg (SupportsArsenal(x) \land SupportsManUtd(x))  \\
  \forall x.  \neg (SupportsLiverpool(x) \land SupportsManUtd(x))  \\
  \qquad \qquad \qquad \vdots
\end{array}
\]

\NI Or, if we treat the football-teams as objects, and have a
two-place $Supports$ relation between people and teams, we could have:
\[
   \forall x, y, z. (Supports(x,y) \land y \neq z \rightarrow \neg Supports(x,z))
\]   

\NI Together with the Unique Names Assumption (which lets us assume
that each football team is distinct from all the others), this
certainly captures the desired uniqueness condition.  But it does so
by using relatively complex logical machinery.

\subsection{Supporting Inferences from Dyadic to Monadic Predicates in Predicate Logic}
If we want to capture the inference from ``Jack loves Jill`` to ``Jack loves'' in predicate logic, we have to add a non-logical axiom:
\[
(\forall x, y) Loves(x,y) \rightarrow Loves(x)
\]

\NI We would have to add an extra non-logical axiom like this for every
n-place predicate.  This is cumbersome at best.  In \ELABR{}, by
contrast, we do not need to introduce any non-logical machinery at all
to capture these inferences because they all follow from the general
rule that $\MAY{a} \MAY{b} \models \MAY{a}$.

\subsection{Supporting adverbial inferences in predicate logic}

\NI How can we represent verbs in traditional predicate logic so as to
support adverbial inference?  Davidson \cite{davidson2} proposed that
every $n$-place action verb be analysed as an $n$+1-place predicate,
with an additional slot representing an event.  For example, he
analysed ``I flew my spaceship to the Morning Star'' as
\[
\exists x. ( Flew(I, MySpaceship, x) \land To(x, TheMorningStar))
\]
This implies 
\[
\exists x.  Flew(I, MySpaceship, x)
\]
This captures the inference from ``I flew my spaceship to the Morning Star'' to ``I flew my spaceship''.

Predicate Logic cannot support logical inferences between elementary propositions. 
If it is going to support inferences from adverbial sentences, it \emph{cannot} treat them as elementary propositions and must instead \emph{reinterpret} them as logically complex propositions.
The cost of Davidson's proposal is that a seemingly simple sentence, such as ``Jones walks'', turns out on closer inspection not be elementary at all,  but to involve existential quantification:
\[
\exists x.  Walks(Jones, x)
\]

\NI Although Predicate Logic can handle some of these inferences, it
can only do so by reinterpreting the sentences as logically-complex
compound propositions.

\subsection{Summary}
We have looked at various types of inference between atomic
sentences. \ELFULL{} can handle them directly and naturally.  Traditional
\fol has a harder time: it
\emph{can} express incompatibility, but only using complex machinery -
universal quantification, a conditional, negation. \ELFULL{}, by
contrast, expresses the source of the incompatibility \emph{directly}
using the $!$ operator.  Again, \fol \emph{can} express
adverbial inferences, but at the cost of using quantification over
events.  When it comes to inferences from conjunctions of sentences to
conjunctions of noun-phrases (or predicates), \fol has
nothing to say because it has no way of expressing conjunctions
between noun-phrases (or predicates) \emph{at all}. In \fol, ``Jack is bruised and humiliated'' has to be regimented into
``Jack is bruised and Jack is humiliated''.  This might seem, to the uninitiated, to be the
wrong way around.  

However, eremic logic cannot handle all instances
of sub-propositional inferences.  An example are inferences where the
\emph{subjects} are conjoined such as
\begin{quote}
``Jack loves Jill'' and ``Jim loves Jill'' together imply that ``Jack and Jim love Jill''
\end{quote}

\NI \ELFULL{} has no way to conjoin noun-phrases in subject-position.
