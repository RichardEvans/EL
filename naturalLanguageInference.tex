\NI \Cathoristic{} arose in part as an attempt to answer the
question: what is the simplest logic that can capture inferences
between atomic sentences of natural language?  In this section, we
give examples of such inferences, and then show how \cathoristic{}
handles them.  We also compare our approach with attempts at
expressing the inferences in first-order logic.

\subsection{Intra-atomic inferences in \cathoristic{}}

\NI Natural language admits many types of inference between atomic
sentences.  First, exclusion:
\begin{quote}
``Jack is male'' is incompatible with ``Jack is female''.
\end{quote}
Second, entailment inferences from dyadic to monadic predicates:
\begin{quote}
``Jack loves Jill'' implies ``Jack loves''.
\end{quote}
Third, adverbial inferences:
\begin{quote}
``Jack walks quickly'' implies ``Jack walks''.
\end{quote}
Fourth, inferences from conjunctions of sentences to conjunctions of noun-phrases (and vice-versa):
\begin{quote}
``Jack loves Jill'' and ``Jack loves Joan'' together imply that ``Jack loves Jill and Joan''.
\end{quote}
Fifth, inferences from conjunctions of sentences to conjunction of
predicates\footnote{See \cite{sommers} p.282 for a spirited defence of
  predicate conjunction against Fregean regimentation.} (and
vice-versa):
\begin{quote}
``Jack is bruised'' and ``Jack is humiliated'' together imply that ``Jack is bruised and humiliated''.
\end{quote}

\NI They all can be handled directly and naturally in \cathoristic{}, as we
shall now show.

%% We shall show that each of the following inferences can be naturally expressed in \cathoristic{}:
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item
%% ``Jack is male'' is incompatible with ``Jack is female''
%% \item
%% ``Jack loves Jill'' implies ``Jack loves''\footnote{Although natural languages are full of examples of inferences from dyadic to monadic predicates, there are certain supposed counterexamples to the general rule that a dyadic predicate always implies a monadic one. For example, ``Jack explodes the device'' does not, on its most natural reading, imply that ``Jack explodes''. Our response to cases like this is to distinguish between two distinct monadic predicates $explodes_1$ and $explodes_2$:
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item
%% $X explodes_1$ iff $X$ is an object that undergoes an explosion
%% \item
%% $X explodes_2$ iff $X$ is an agent that initiates an explosion
%% \end{itemize}
%% Now ``Jack explodes the device'' does imply that ``Jack $explodes_2$'' but does not imply that ``Jack $explodes_1$''. 
%% There is no deep problem here - just another case where natural language overloads the same word in different situation to have different meanings.}
%% \item
%% ``Jack walks quickly'' implies ``Jack walks''
%% \item
%% ``Jack loves Jill'' and ``Jack loves Joan'' together imply that ``Jack loves Jill and Joan''
%% \item
%% ``Jack is bruised'' and ``Jack is humiliated'' together imply that ``Jack is bruised and humiliated''.
%% \end{itemize}

Incompatibility, such as that between ``Jack is male'' and ``Jack is
female'', is translated into \cathoristic{} as the pair of incompatible
sentences:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\MAY{jack} \MAY{sex} (\MAY{male} \land \fBang \{male\}) 
   \qquad\qquad
\MAY{jack} \MAY{sex} (\MAY{female} \land \fBang \{female\}).
\end{eqnarray*}

\NI \Cathoristic{} handles entailments from dyadic to monadic predicates\footnote{Although
  natural languages are full of examples of inferences from dyadic to
  monadic predicates, there are certain supposed counterexamples to
  the general rule that a dyadic predicate always implies a monadic
  one. For example, ``Jack explodes the device'' does not, on its most
  natural reading, imply that ``Jack explodes''. Our response to cases
  like this is to distinguish between two distinct monadic predicates
  $explodes_1$ and $explodes_2$:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item
 $X explodes_1$ iff $X$ is an object that undergoes an explosion
 \item
 $X explodes_2$ iff $X$ is an agent that initiates an explosion
 \end{itemize}
 Now ``Jack explodes the device'' does imply that ``Jack $explodes_2$'' but does not imply that ``Jack $explodes_1$''. 
There is no deep problem here - just another case where natural language overloads the same word in different situation to have different meanings.}.
``Jack loves Jill'' is translated into \cathoristic{} as:
\begin{eqnarray*}
   \MAY{jack} \MAY{loves} \MAY{jill}.
\end{eqnarray*}
The semantics of modalities ensures that this directly entails:
\begin{eqnarray*}
   \MAY{jack} \MAY{loves}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\NI Similarly, \cathoristic{} supports inferences from triadic to dyadic
predicates:
\begin{quote}
  ``Jack passed the biscuit to Mary'' implies ``Jack passed the biscuit''.
\end{quote}

\NI This can be expressed directly in \cathoristic{} as:
\[
   \MAY{jack} \MAY{passed} \MAY{biscuit} \MAY{to} (\MAY{mary} \land !\{mary\}) \models \MAY{jack} \MAY{passed} \MAY{biscuit}.
\]

\NI Adverbial inferences is captured in \cathoristic{} as follows.
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \MAY{jack} \MAY{walks} \MAY{quickly}
\end{eqnarray*}
entails:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \MAY{jack} \MAY{walks}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\NI \Cathoristic{} directly supports inferences from conjunctions of
sentences to conjunctions of noun-phrases.  As our models are
deterministic, we have the general rule that $ \MAY{a} \MAY{b} \land
\MAY{a} \MAY{c} \models \MAY{a} (\MAY{b} \land \MAY{c})$ from which
it follows that
\begin{eqnarray*}
   \MAY{jack} \MAY{loves} \MAY{jill}
      \qquad\text{and}\qquad
   \MAY{jack} \MAY{loves} \MAY{joan}
\end{eqnarray*}
together imply
\begin{eqnarray*}
\MAY{jack} \MAY{loves} (\MAY{jill} \land \MAY{joan}).
\end{eqnarray*}

\NI Using the same rule, we can infer that
\begin{eqnarray*}
   \MAY{jack} \MAY{bruised} \land \MAY{jack} \MAY{humiliated}
\end{eqnarray*}

\NI together imply
\begin{eqnarray*}
\MAY{jack} (\MAY{bruised} \land \MAY{humiliated}).
\end{eqnarray*}
 
\subsection{Intra-atomic inferences in \fol{}}
Next, we look at how these inferences are handled in \fol{}.

\subsubsection{Incompatible predicates in \fol{}}\label{incompatiblepredicatesinfol}

\NI How are incompatible predicates represented in \fol{}?  Brachman
and Levesque \cite{brachman} introduce the topic by remarking:
\begin{quote}
   We would consider it quite ``obvious'' in this domain that if it
   were asserted that $John$ were a $Man$, then we should answer
   ``no'' to the query $Woman(John)$.
\end{quote}

\NI They propose adding an extra axiom to express the incompatibility:
\[
   \forall x. ( Man(x) \IMPLIES \neg Woman(x) )
\]  
 
\NI This proposal imposes a burden on the knowledge-representer: an
extra axiom must be added for every pair of incompatible predicates.
This is burdensome for large sets of incompatible predicates.  For
example, suppose there are 50 football teams, and a person can only
support one team at a time.  We would need to add ${50 \choose
  2}$ axioms, which is unwieldy.
\[
\begin{array}{l}
  \forall x.  \neg (SupportsArsenal(x) \land SupportsLiverpool(x))  \\
  \forall x.  \neg (SupportsArsenal(x) \land SupportsManUtd(x))  \\
  \forall x.  \neg (SupportsLiverpool(x) \land SupportsManUtd(x))  \\
  \qquad \qquad \qquad \vdots
\end{array}
\]

\NI Or, if we treat the football-teams as objects, and have a
two-place $Supports$ relation between people and teams, we could have:
\[
   \forall x y z . (Supports(x,y) \land y \neq z \IMPLIES \neg Supports(x,z)).
\]   

\NI If we also assume that each football team is distinct from all 
others, this certainly captures the desired uniqueness condition.  But
it does so by using relatively complex logical machinery.



\subsubsection{Inferences from dyadic to monadic predicates in \fol{}}
If we want to capture the inference from ``Jack loves Jill`` to ``Jack
loves'' in \fol{}, we can use a non-logical axiom:
\[
   \forall x. y .( Loves_2(x,y) \IMPLIES Loves_1(x))
\]

\NI We would have to add an extra  axiom like this for every
$n$-place predicate.  This is cumbersome at best.  In \cathoristic{}, by
contrast, we do not need to introduce any non-logical machinery 
to capture these inferences because they all follow from the general
rule that $\MAY{a} \MAY{b} \models \MAY{a}$.

\subsubsection{Adverbial inferences in \fol{}}

\NI How can we represent verbs in traditional \fol{} so as to
support adverbial inference?  Davidson \cite{davidson2} proposes that
every $n$-place action verb be analysed as an $n$+1-place predicate,
with an additional slot representing an event.  For example, he
analyses ``I flew my spaceship to the Morning Star'' as
\[
\exists x. ( Flew(I, MySpaceship, x) \land To(x, TheMorningStar))
\]
This implies 
\[
\exists x.  Flew(I, MySpaceship, x)
\]
This captures the inference from ``I flew my spaceship to the Morning
Star'' to ``I flew my spaceship''.

First-order logic cannot support logical inferences between atomic
sentences.  If it is going to support inferences from adverbial
sentences, it \emph{cannot} treat them as atomic and must instead
\emph{reinterpret} them as logically complex propositions.  The cost
of Davidson's proposal is that a seemingly simple sentence - such as
``Jones walks'' - turns out, on closer inspection, not to be atomic at
all - but to involve existential quantification:
\[
\exists x.  Walks(Jones, x)
\]

\NI First-order logic \emph{can} handle such inferences - but only by
reinterpreting the sentences as logically-complex compound
propositions.
