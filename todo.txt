* Finalise the name of the logic. I am going to check with my friend Tim Whitmarsh one more time that "Eremic Logic" is the best name for it.

* Find a better name for !A than "bang A".

* Be consistent. In particular

  - Either all definitions are in an explicit \begin{definition}
    environment or none.

  - Term defined should always be \textbf{...} or \textsc{...} etc.

*  I recommend to use the following order of presentation in Chapters 2 and 3.

  - Formulae
  - Models and the satisfaction relation.
  - Rules and axioms
  - Soundness of rules and axioms
  - Completeness of rules and axioms
  - Other stuff (Translation into FOL, decision procedure etc).

  I think it might also help if we relegate standard proofs to the
  appendix.  For example we could just state the soundness theorem in
  the main body of the paper, prove 2 or 3 interesting cases, and have
  the rest in the appendix. I also prefer it if ther proof rules are
  all in one figure, rather than distributed over a couple of pages.

  - Rules and axioms in figures.

  - Easy proof go in the appendix

* Timetable: 13.May to 16.May, can we finish it?

* Find possible reviewers (please add more):

* Could it make sense to prepare a little video presentation (using
  Screenflow, or recording professionally), maybe 15 minutes, to
  introduce the material? This could make it more accessible to
  non-technical audiences.)

* Prepare Haskell decision procedure. Put on Github. Write
  instructions on how to use.

* THink about how to interface the paper with Versu.  Versuâ€”A
  Simulationist Storytelling System

* Think about seminars (Sussex, Imperial, Oxford, QMUL which others?)
