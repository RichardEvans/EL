\section{Core eremic logic: the EL$[\AND, !]$ fragment}

\subsection{Syntax}

\begin{definition} Given a set $\mathcal{S}$ of symbols, with $a$ ranging over
$\mathcal{S}$, and $A$ ranging over finite subsets of $\mathcal{S}$,
the sentences of EL$[\AND, !]$ are given by:

\begin{GRAMMAR}
  \phi 
     &\quad ::= \quad & 
  \top 
     \VERTICAL 
  \phi_1 \AND \phi_2  
     \VERTICAL 
  \MAY{a}{\phi}
     \VERTICAL 
  \fBang A 
\end{GRAMMAR}

\NI The $!$ operator is used to restrict the allowable transitions
coming out of a state.  Intuitively, $\fBang A$ means that the
\emph{only} transitions coming out of the current state are those
specified in $A$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Semantics}

\begin{definition}
A {\bf model} is a triple $(\mathcal{W}, \rightarrow, \lambda)$,
containing a Labeled Transition System (a set of states $\mathcal{W}$,
and a transition relation $\rightarrow \; \subseteq \; \mathcal{W}
\times \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{W}$), together with a
node-labelling $\lambda$ that maps each element of $\mathcal{W}$ to a
subset of $\mathcal{S}$.
\end{definition}
The intended interpretation is that $\lambda(w)$ is the set of allowed transition symbols emanating from $w$.
The $\lambda$ function is the semantic counterpart of the $!$ operator.

Now, for a model to be valid, we insist that the transitions coming out of a node $w$ are a subset of the allowed transitions in $\lambda(w)$:
\begin{definition}
A model $(\mathcal{W}, \rightarrow, \lambda)$ is {\bf valid} iff for all $w \in \mathcal{W}$, $ \{s \fOr \exists w' \; w \xrightarrow{s} w'\} \subseteq \lambda(w)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A {\bf pointed model} is a pair $(l,w)$, where $m$ is a \emph{valid} model of the form $(\mathcal{W}, \rightarrow, \lambda)$, and $w$ is a distinguished state in $\mathcal{W}$.
\end{definition}
Formulae are interpreted in a pointed model $(l,w)$:
\begin{eqnarray}
(l,w) & \models & \top  \mbox{ always } \nonumber \\
(l,w) & \models & \phi_1 \AND \phi_2 \mbox{ iff } (l,w)  \models \phi_1 \mbox { and } (l,w) \models \phi_2 \nonumber \\
(l,w) & \models & \langle a \rangle \phi \mbox{ iff there is a } w \xrightarrow{a} w' \mbox { such that } (l,w') \models \phi \nonumber \\
(l,w) & \models & \fBang A \mbox{ iff } \lambda(w) \subseteq A\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Note that if a model is valid then $(l,w) \models \fBang A$ implies $\{s \fOr \exists w' \; w \xrightarrow{s} w'\} \subseteq A$.
From now on, we will restrict ourselves to valid models.

\subsection{Inference Rules}
In EL, a judgement is of the form:
\[
A \judge B
\]
Here, $A$ and $B$ are \emph{single terms}.
To avoid the need for structural inference rules, we restrict sequents to single terms on the left and right hand side.

\subsection{Standard Rules}
EL has the following standard axioms and inference-rules:
Our first axiom is {\bf Identity}:
\[
\boxed
{
X \judge X
}
\]
{\bf $\top$ Right} states that $\top$ is always provable:
\[
\boxed
{
X \judge \top
}
\]
{\bf $\bot$ Left} states that anything is provable from $\bot$:
\[
\boxed
{
\bot \judge X
}
\]
Note that $\bot$ is not a primitive symbol of EL - it is defined as one of the unsatisfiable terms, for example $\langle a \rangle \top \; \AND \; \fBang \{\}$. 

EL has the standard transitivity inference rule:
\begin{center}
\fbox{
\AxiomC{$X \judge Y$}
\AxiomC{$Y \judge Z$}
\LeftLabel{{\bf Transitivity: \quad}}
\BinaryInfC{$X \judge Z$}
\DisplayProof
}
\end{center}
It has the standard three rules for handling conjunction:
\begin{center}
\fbox{
\AxiomC{$X \judge Y$}
\LeftLabel{{\bf $\AND$ Left 1: \quad}}
\UnaryInfC{$X \AND Z \judge Y$}
\DisplayProof
}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\fbox{
\AxiomC{$X \judge Y$}
\LeftLabel{{\bf $\AND$ Left 2: \quad}}
\UnaryInfC{$Z \AND X \judge Y$}
\DisplayProof
}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\fbox{
\AxiomC{$X \judge Y$}
\AxiomC{$X \judge Z$}
\LeftLabel{{\bf $\AND$ Right: \quad}}
\BinaryInfC{$X \judge Y \AND Z$}
\DisplayProof
}
\end{center}

\subsection{Rules Unique to EL}
EL has six rules for capturing its distinctive properties: the relations betwen $\langle \rangle$, $!$ and $\bot$.
The {\bf Bottom Right 1} axiom captures how $\langle \rangle$ and $!$ interact:
\[
\boxed
{
\langle a \rangle X \AND \fBang A \judge \bot \mbox{ if } a \notin A
}
\]
{\bf Bottom Right 2} is another axiom for deriving $\bot$ from inside $\langle \rangle$:
\[
\boxed
{
\langle a \rangle \bot \judge \bot
}
\]
There is a rule for strengthening $\fBang$ on the left hand side: 
\begin{center}
\fbox{
\AxiomC{$X \AND \fBang A \judge Y$}
\LeftLabel{{\bf ! Left: \quad}}
\RightLabel{where $A' \subseteq A $}
\UnaryInfC{$X \AND \fBang A' \judge Y$}
\DisplayProof
}
\end{center}
There is a rule for weakening $\fBang$ on the right hand side: 
\begin{center}
\fbox{
\AxiomC{$X \judge \fBang A$}
\LeftLabel{{\bf ! Right 1: \quad}}
\RightLabel{where $A \subseteq A'$}
\UnaryInfC{$X \judge \fBang A'$}
\DisplayProof
}
\end{center}
There is a rule for taking the intersection of two $!$s on the right hand side:
\begin{center}
\fbox{
\AxiomC{$X \judge \fBang A_1$}
\AxiomC{$X \judge \fBang A_2$}
\LeftLabel{{\bf ! Right 2: \quad}}
\BinaryInfC{$X \judge \fBang (A_1 \cap A_2)$}
\DisplayProof
}
\end{center}
Finally, there is a rule for adding transitions to judgements:
\begin{center}
\fbox{
\AxiomC{$X \judge Y$}
\LeftLabel{{\bf Transition Normal: \quad}}
\UnaryInfC{$\langle a \rangle X \judge \langle a \rangle Y$}
\DisplayProof
}
\end{center}

\subsection{Soundness and completeness}

We will show that $p \models q$ implies there is a derivation of $p \judge q$.
Our proof will make use of two lemmas:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Lemma 4: if $m \models p$ then $\theta(m) \judge p$.
\item
Lemma 5: for all terms $p$, $p \judge \theta(\mu(p))$.
\end{itemize}
With these two lemmas in hand, the proof is straightforward.
\begin{theorem}
If $p \models q$ then $p \judge q$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Assume $p \models q$. 
Then all models which satisfy $p$ also satisfy $q$.
In particular, $\mu(p) \models q$.
Then $\theta(\mu(p)) \judge q$ by Lemma 1.
But we also have, by Lemma 2, $p \judge \theta(\mu(p)) $.
So by transitivity, we have $p \judge q$.
\qed
\end{proof}
Next we will prove Lemma 4.
\begin{lemma}
If $m \models p$ then $\theta(m) \judge p$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Induction on $p$.
\setcounter{mycase}{0}

\begin{mycase}
$p$ is $\top$
\end{mycase}
Then we can prove  $\theta(m) \judge p$ immediately using axiom {\bf $\top$ Right}.

\begin{mycase}
$p$ is $q \AND q'$
\end{mycase}
By the induction hypothesis, $\theta(m) \judge q$ and $\theta(m) \judge q'$.
The proof of $\theta(m) \judge q \AND q'$ follows immediately using {\bf $\AND$ Right}.

\begin{mycase}
$p$ is $\langle a \rangle q$
\end{mycase}
If $m \models \langle a \rangle q$, then either $m = \bot$ or $m$ is a pointed model of the form $(l,w)$.
\begin{subcase}
$m = \bot$
\end{subcase}
In this case, $\theta(m) = \theta(\bot) = \bot$. (Recall, that we are overloading $\bot$ to mean both the pointed model at the bottom of our lattice and a formula (such as $\langle s \rangle \top \AND !\{\}$) which is always false).
In this case, $ \theta(\bot) \judge  \langle a \rangle q$ using {\bf $\bot$ Left}.

\begin{subcase}
 $m$ is a pointed model of the form $(l,w)$
 \end{subcase}
Given $m \models \langle a \rangle q$, and that $m$ is a pointed model of the form $(l,w)$, we know that:
\[
(l,w) \models \langle a \rangle q
\]
From the satisfaction clause for $\langle a \rangle$, it follows that:
\[
\exists w' \mbox{ such that } w \xrightarrow{a} w' \mbox { and } (l,w') \models q
\]
By the induction hypothesis:
\[
\theta( (l,w') ) \judge q
\]
Now by {\bf Transition Normal}:
\[
\langle a \rangle \theta( (l,w') ) \judge \langle a \rangle q
\]
Using repeated application of {\bf $\AND$ Left}, we can show:
\[
\theta((l,w)) \judge \langle a \rangle \theta((l,w'))
\]
Finally, using {\bf Transitivity}, we derive:
\[
\theta((l,w)) \judge  \langle a \rangle q
\]
\begin{mycase}
$p$ is $\fBang q$
\end{mycase}
If $(l,w) \models \fBang A$, then $\lambda(w) \subseteq A$.
Then $\theta(l,w) = ! \; \lambda(w) \AND \phi$.
Now we can prove $! \; \lambda(w) \AND \phi \judge \fBang A$ using  {\bf $!$ Right 1} and repeated applications of {\bf $\AND$ Left}.
\qed
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
For all terms $p$, we can derive $p \judge \theta(\mu(p))$.
\end{lemma}
Explanation: $\mu(p)$ is the simplest model satisfying $p$, and $\theta(m)$ is the simplest formula describing $m$, so $\theta(\mu(p))$ is a simplified form of $p$. This lemma states that EL has the inferential capacity to transform any proposition into its simplified form.
\begin{proof}
Induction on $p$.

\setcounter{mycase}{0}

\begin{mycase}
$p$ is $\top$
\end{mycase}
Then we can prove  $\top \judge \top$ using either {\bf $\top$ Right} or {\bf Identity}.

\begin{mycase}
$p$ is $q \AND q'$
\end{mycase}
By the induction hypothesis, $q \judge \theta(\mu(q))$ and $q' \judge \theta(\mu(q'))$.
Using {\bf $\AND$ Left} and {\bf $\AND$ Right}, we can show:
\[
q \AND q' \judge \theta(\mu(q)) \AND \theta(\mu(q'))
\]
Lemma 6, proven below, states that, for all models $m$ and $n$:
\[
\theta(m) \AND \theta(n) \judge \theta (m \sqcap n)
\]
From Lemma 6 (substituting $\mu(q)$ for $m$ and $\mu(q')$ for $n$), it follows that:
\[
\theta(\mu(q)) \AND \theta(\mu(q')) \judge \theta(\mu(q \AND q'))
\]
Our desired result follows using {\bf Transitivity}.

\begin{mycase}
$p$ is $\langle a \rangle q$
\end{mycase}
By the induction hypothesis, $q \judge \theta(\mu(q))$.
Now there are two sub-cases to consider, depending on whether or not $\theta(\mu(q)) = \bot$.
\begin{subcase}
$\theta(\mu(q)) = \bot$
\end{subcase}
In this case, $\theta(\mu(\langle a \rangle q))$ also equals $\bot$. 
By the induction hypothesis:
\[
q \judge \bot
\]
By {\bf Transition Normal}:
\[
\langle a \rangle q \judge \langle a \rangle \bot
\]
By {\bf Bottom Right 2}:
\[
\langle a \rangle \bot \judge \bot
\]
The desired proof that:
\[
\langle a \rangle q \judge \bot
\]
follows by {\bf Transitivity}.
\begin{subcase}
$\theta(\mu(q)) \neq \bot$
\end{subcase}
By the induction hypothesis, $q \judge \theta(\mu(q))$.
So, by {\bf Transition Normal}:
\[
\langle a \rangle q \judge \langle a \rangle \theta(\mu(q))
\]
The desired conclusion follows from noting that:
\[
 \langle a \rangle \theta(\mu(q)) = \theta(\mu(\langle a \rangle q))
 \]
 \begin{mycase}
$p$ is $\fBang A$
\end{mycase}
If $p$ is $\fBang A$, then $ \theta(\mu(p))$ is $\fBang A \AND \top$.
We can prove $\fBang A \judge \fBang A \AND \top$ using {\bf $\AND$ Right}, {\bf $\top$ Right} and {\bf Identity}.
\qed
\end{proof}
Finally, to fill the hole in Case 2 above, we need to show that:
\begin{lemma}
For all models $m$ and $n$, $\theta(m) \AND \theta(n) \judge \theta (m \sqcap n)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

There are two cases to consider, depending on whether or not $(m \sqcap n) = \bot$.

\setcounter{mycase}{0}

\begin{mycase}
$(m \sqcap n) = \bot$
\end{mycase}
If $(m \sqcap n) = \bot$, there are three possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item
$m = \bot$
\item
$n = \bot$
\item
Neither $m$ nor $n$ are $\bot$, but together they are incompatible. 
\end{itemize}
If either $m$ or $n$ is $\bot$, then the proof is a simple application of {\bf Identity} followed by {\bf $\AND$ Left}.

Next, let us consider the case where neither $m$ nor $n$ are $\bot$, but together they are incompatible.
Let $m$ be the pointed model $(l, w)$ and let $n$ be $(l', w')$.
If $(l, w) \sqcap (l', w') = \bot$, then\footnote{The alternative, in which the $s$-transition is in $n$ and the transition-restriction is in $m$, is identical, swapping $m$ with $n$.} there exists a symbol $s$ and a state $w_2$ such that $w \xrightarrow{s} w_2$ but $s \notin \lambda'(w')$.

In this case, by the definition of $\theta$, $\theta(m) \judge \langle s \rangle \top$, using  {\bf Identity} and repeated applications of {\bf $\AND$ Left}.
Further, by the definition of $\theta$, $\theta(n) \judge \; ! \; \lambda'(w')$, using  {\bf Identity} and repeated applications of by {\bf $\AND$ Left}. Again, $s \notin  \lambda'(w')$.

Therefore,  $\theta(m) \AND \theta(n) \judge \bot$, using  {\bf $\AND$ Right} and  {\bf Bottom Right 1}.
\begin{mycase}
$(m \sqcap n) \neq \bot$
\end{mycase}
In this case, let $(l,w) = m$ and let $(l',w')=n$.
Then, from the definition of $\mathsf{merge}$ above:
\[
\theta((l,w) \sqcap (l',w')) = \; ! \; (\lambda(w) \cap \lambda'(w')) \AND \bigwedge_{w \xrightarrow{s} w_2} \langle s \rangle \theta((l, w_2)) \AND \bigwedge_{w' \xrightarrow{s} w_3} \langle s \rangle \theta((l', w_3))
\]
We need to show that $\theta((l,w)) \AND \theta((l',w')) \judge \theta((l,w) \sqcap (l',w'))$ - or in other words, that:
\begin{itemize}
\item
$\theta((l,w)) \AND \theta((l',w')) \judge \; ! \; (\lambda(w) \cap \lambda'(w'))$
\item
$\theta((l,w)) \AND \theta((l',w')) \judge \langle s \rangle \theta((l, w_2))$ for all $s,w_2$ such that $w \xrightarrow{s} w_2$
\item
$\theta((l,w)) \AND \theta((l',w')) \judge \langle s \rangle \theta((l, w_3))$ for all $s,w_3$ such that $w' \xrightarrow{s} w_3$
\end{itemize}
To show $\theta((l,w)) \AND \theta((l',w')) \judge \; ! \; (\lambda(w) \cap \lambda'(w'))$, note that $\theta((l,w))  \judge \; ! \; \lambda(w)$ and $\theta((l',w')) \judge \; ! \;  \lambda'(w'))$.
We can derive $\theta((l,w)) \AND \theta((l',w')) \judge \; ! \; (\lambda(w) \cap \lambda'(w'))$ using {\bf $\AND$ Right} and {\bf $!$ Right 2}. 

To show $\theta((l,w)) \AND \theta((l',w')) \judge \langle s \rangle \theta((l, w_2))$, observe from the definition of $\theta$ that $\theta((l,w))$ contains a conjunct $\langle s \rangle \theta((l, w_2))$, so the proof follows from  {\bf $\AND$ Right} and repeated applications of  {\bf $\AND$ Left}. The same procedure applies to show $\theta((l,w)) \AND \theta((l',w')) \judge \langle s \rangle \theta((l, w_3))$ for all $s,w_3$ such that $w' \xrightarrow{s} w_3$.

This completes Lemma 6 and hence the Completeness Proof.
\qed

\end{proof}

\subsection{The standard translation from  EL into FOL}

We will translate EL into a restricted fragment of FOL.
There are three types of predicate:
\begin{itemize}
\item
A 0-place predicate $\top$, which is true in all models.
\item
A set of two-place predicates $Arr_s(x, y)$, one for each $s \in \mathcal{S}$, where $x$ and $y$ are of type $State$. $Arr_s(x, y)$ is true if $x \xrightarrow{s} y$.
\item
A set of one-place predicates $Restrict_A$, one for each finite subset $A \subseteq \mathcal{S}$. 
$Restrict_{A}(x)$ is true if $\lambda(x) = A$.
\end{itemize}
With $x_1, x_2$ being state variables, $s$ a symbol in $\mathcal{S}$, and $A$ ranging over subsets of $\mathcal{S}$, our restricted fragment of FOL has sentences of the form:
\begin{GRAMMAR}
  \phi 
     &\quad ::= \quad&
  \top \fOr Arr_{s}(x_1, x_2)\fOr Restrict_A(x_1) \fOr \phi_1 \AND \phi_2 \fOr \exists x_1 . \phi 
\end{GRAMMAR}
Notice that this fragment of FOL has no negation, disjunction, implication, or universal quantification.

The translation of an EL formula is relative to a variable $x$ (which will be instantiated to the particular state at which we are evaluating the formula):
\begin{eqnarray}
T_x(\top) & = & \top \nonumber \\
T_x(\phi_1 \AND \phi_2) & = & T_x(\phi_1) \AND T_x(\phi_2) \nonumber \\
T_x(\langle s \rangle \phi) & = & \exists y \; . \; Arr_s(x,y) \AND T_y(\phi) \nonumber \\
T_x(\fBang A) & = & Restrict_A(x) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
So, for example:
\[
T_x(\langle a \rangle \top \AND \fBang \{a\}) = \exists y \; . \; Arr_a(x,y) \AND \top \AND Restrict_{\{a\}}(x)
\]


\subsection{Compactness}
