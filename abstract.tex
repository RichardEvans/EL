\Cathoristic{} is a multi-modal logic where negation is replaced by a
novel operator allowing the expression of incompatible sentences.  
We present the syntax and semantics of the logic including complete proof rules, and
establish a number of results such as compactness, a semantic
characterisation of elementary equivalence, the existence of a
quadratic-time decision procedure, and Brandom's incompatibility
semantics property.  
We demonstrate the usefulness of the logic as a language for knowledge representation.
