\ELFULL{} is a multi-modal logic where negation is replaced by a
novel operator expressing exclusion between sentences.  We present the
syntax and semantics of the logic including complete proof rules, and
establish a number of results such as compactness, a semantic
characterisation of elementary equivalence, the existence of a
linear-time decision procedure, and Brandom's Incompatibility
Semantics property.  We demonstrate the usefulness of the logic with
applications in the philosophy of language and knowledge
representation.
