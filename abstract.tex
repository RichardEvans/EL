\begin{abstract}
Eremic Logic is a simple modal logic for capturing inferences between ``atomic'' sentences. 
It is the only Hennessy-Milner style logic satisfying the Hennessy-Milner theorem that has a linear-time decision procedure.
It has been put to use in an industrial application, as the representational core of a new logic programming language. The resulting code is shorter, less error-prone, and more efficient than the corresponding code in traditional predicate logic.
