\input{figure:relationships}
Consider the following six languages:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l | r }
Language & Description \\
\hline
PL[$\land$] & Propositional Logic restricted to the $\land$ operator \\
HML[$\land$] & Hennessy-Milner Logic restricted to the $\land$ operator \\
EL[$\land, !$] & Eremic Logic restricted to the $\land$ and $\fBang$ operators \\
PL [$\land, \neg$] & Full Propositional Logic \\
HML [$\land, \neg$] & Full Hennessy-Milner Logic \\
EL [$\land, !, \neg$] & Full Eremic Logic \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Now the top three languages are simple to the point of triviality. In each case:
\begin{itemize}
\item
There is no facility for expressing disjunction
\item
Every formula that is satisfiable has a simplest satisfying model
\item
There is a simple linear-time decision procedure
\end{itemize}
But there are two ways in which EL[$\land, !$]  is significantly more expressive.

Firstly, EL[$\land, !$], unlike either PL[$\land$] or HML[$\land$] , is expressive enough to be able to distinguish between any two models that are not bisimilar. (See Theorem \ref{hennessymilnertheorem}).

The second way in which EL[$\land, !$] is significantly more expressive than both PL[$\land$] and HML[$\land$] is in its ability to express incompatibility.
No two formulae of PL[$\land$] (or HML[$\land$] ) are incompatible with each other. 
But many pairs of formulae of EL[$\land, !$] are incompatible.
(For example: $\langle a \rangle \top$ and $! []$). 
Because EL[$\land, !$]  is expressive enough to be able to make incompatible claims, it satisfies Brandom's property of {\bf Incompatibility Semantics\footnote{$\INC{p}$ is the set of sets of formulae incompatible with $p$.}}:
\[
p \models q \mbox{ iff } \INC{q} \subseteq \INC{p}
\]
EL[$\land, !$]  is the \emph{only} logic with a linear-time decision procedure that is expressive enough to respect Incompatibility Semantics.

The bottom three language can all be decided in exponential time.
But HML is more expressive than PL, and EL [$\land, !, \neg$]  is more expressive than full HML. 
\begin{proposition}
Full HML  is more expressive than full PL.
\end{proposition}
To see this, fix a PL with the nullary operator $\top$ plus an infinite number of propositional atoms $P_{(i,j)}$, indexed by $i$ and $j$.
Now translate each formula of HML via the rules:
\begin{eqnarray*}
t(\top)  & = & \top  \\
t(\phi \land \psi) & = & t(\phi) \land t(\psi)  \\
t(\neg \phi) & = & \neg t(\phi)   \\
t(\langle a_i \rangle \phi_j) & = & P_{(i,j)} 
\end{eqnarray*}
Now to show that HML is more expressive, we show that there are formulae $\phi$ and $\psi$ of HML such that
\[
\phi \models_{HML} \psi \mbox{ but } t(\phi) \nvDash_{PL} t(\psi)
\]
For example, let $\phi = \langle a \rangle \langle b \rangle \top$ and $\psi = \langle a \rangle \top$.
Clearly, $\phi \models_{HML} \psi$. But $t(\phi) = P_{(i,j)}$ and $t(\psi) = P_{(i',j')}$ for some $i,j,i',j'$, and there are no entailments in PL between arbitrary propositional atoms.

\begin{proposition}
EL [$\land, !, \neg$]  is more expressive than full HML
\end{proposition}
Given a background set $\Sigma$ of symbols, the formula $\fBang A$ of EL can be translated into HML as:
\[
\bigwedge_{a \in \Sigma - A} \neg \langle a \rangle \top
\]
But if $\Sigma$ is infinite, then this is an infinitary disjunction.
