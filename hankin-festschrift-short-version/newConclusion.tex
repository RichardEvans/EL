\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

We have introduced \Cathoristic{} as a system for capturing logical inferences between the \emph{atomic} sentences of natural language.
Now there have been various attempts to capture these inferences by translating into \fol{}.
We have argued that our translation into \Cathoristic{} is more efficient and more ergonomic, because we are translating into a simple propositional logic - rather than a complex quantificational logic.
We have used \Cathoristic{} as the basis for a logic-programming language that has served in an industrial AI application.

%We thank Marek Sergot, Tom Smith, and Giacomo Turbanti for their thoughtful comments.
