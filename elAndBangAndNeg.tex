\section{\Cathoristic{} and negation}\label{ELAndNegation}

\NI Our motivation for investigating \cathoristic{} has been to give an
alternative account of negation, based on the concept of exclusion.
In this section we study how (partially) to recover negation. For this
purpose, we enrich \cathoristic{} with negation, and show how negation
can be explained in terms of plain \cathoristic{} with disjunction.

\subsection{Syntax and semantics}

\begin{definition}
Given a set $\Sigma$ of symbols, the \emph{formulae of \cathoristic{}
  with negation} are given by the following grammar.
\begin{GRAMMAR}
  \phi 
     &\quad ::= \quad & 
   \top \fOr \bot \fOr \neg \phi \fOr \phi \land \psi \fOr \langle a \rangle \phi \fOr \fBang A 
\end{GRAMMAR}

\NI We can now define disjunction $\phi \lor \psi$ and implication
$\phi \IMPLIES \psi$ by de Morgan duality: $\phi \OR \psi$ is short
for $\neg (\neg \phi \land \neg \psi )$, and $\phi \IMPLIES \psi$  abbreviates
$\neg\phi \OR \psi$.
\end{definition}

The semantics of \cathoristic\ with negation is just as that of
\cathoristic\ without, except for the obvious clause for negation.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\MMM \models \neg \phi &\quad\mbox{ iff }\quad& \MMM \nvDash \phi  
%\MMM \models \phi \lor \psi &\mbox{ iff }& \MMM \models \phi \text{ or }   \MMM \models \psi
\end{eqnarray*}

\NI Negation is a core operation of classical logic, and its absence makes
\cathoristic{} unusual. In order to understand \cathoristic{} better, we
now investigate how negation can be seen as a definable abbreviation
in \cathoristic{} with disjunction. The key idea is that 
\[
   \neg \MAY{a}{\phi}
\]
can be false in two ways: there is no $a$-labelled action at the
current state, or there is, but $\phi$ is false. Both arms of this
disjunction can be expressed in \cathoristic{}:

\begin{itemize}

\item $!\Sigma \setminus \{a\}$.

\item $\MAY{a}{\neg \phi}$.

\end{itemize}

\NI Hence, we can see $\neg \MAY{a}{\phi}$ as a shorthand for 
\[
   !(\Sigma \setminus \{a\}) \OR \MAY{a}{\neg \phi}
\]

\NI Negation still occurs in this term, but prefixing a formula of
lower complexity.

This leaves the question of negating the tantum. That's easy: when
$\neg !A$, then clearly the current state can do an action $a \notin
A$. In other words
\[
   \BIGOR_{a \in \Sigma}\MAY{a}{\TRUE}
\]

\NI When $\Sigma$ is infinite, then so is the disjunction.

Note that both, the negation of the modality and the negation of
the tantum involve the set $\Sigma$ of actions. It is sometimes
advantageous to translate away negation with respect to a subset $S
\subseteq \Sigma$.  So far, we have defined negation with respect to
the whole (possibly infinite) set $\Sigma$. For technical reasons, we
generalise negation and define it with respect to a \emph{finite}
subset $S \subseteq \Sigma$. We use this finitely-restricted version of
negation in the decision procedure below.

\begin{definition}
The function $\neg_{S}(\phi)$ removes negation from $\phi$
relative to $S \subseteq \Sigma$:

\begin{align*}
  \neg_{S}(\top) &\ =\  \bot  &
  \neg_S(\bot) &\ =\  \top  \\
  \neg_S(\phi \land \psi) &\ =\  \neg_S(\phi) \lor \neg_S(\psi)  &
  \neg_S(\phi \lor \psi) &\ =\  \neg_S(\phi) \land \neg_S(\psi)  \\
  \neg_S(\langle a \rangle \phi) &\ =\  \fBang(S-\{a\}) \lor \langle a \rangle \neg_S(\phi)  &
  \neg_S(\fBang A) &\ =\  \bigvee_{a \in S - A} \langle a \rangle \top
\end{align*}


\end{definition}

\NI Note that, if $S$ is infinite, then the last two clauses will
generate infinitary formulae.

\subsection{A decision procedure}

\NI We can use the fact that the \cathoristic\ has a quadratic-time
decision procedure to build an exponential-time decision procedure for
\cathoristic\ with negation.  Given $\phi \models \psi$, let $S =
\mathsf{symbols}(\phi) \cup \mathsf{symbols}(\psi) \cup \{a\}$ where
$a$ is a new symbol which does not occur in $\phi$ or $\psi$.  First,
translate away all negations in $\phi$ using $\neg_S()$ as defined in
Section 1.4.  Let the result be $\phi'$.  Second, reduce $\phi'$ to
Disjunctive Normal Form by repeated application of the rewrite rules:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\phi \land (\psi \lor \xi) & \quad \leadsto \quad& (\phi \land \psi) \lor (\phi \land \xi)  \\
(\phi \lor \psi) \land \xi & \leadsto & (\phi \land \xi) \lor (\psi \land \xi) 
\end{eqnarray*}
Let the resulting disjuncts be $\phi_1, ..., \phi_n$. 
Now 
\[
\phi \models \psi \quad\text{ iff }\quad \forall \phi_{i=1}^n \phi_i \models \psi
\]
\martin{What does $\forall \phi_{i=1}^n \phi_i$ mean?}
Now, to check whether each $\phi_i \models \psi$, we will construct a
model of $\psi_i$ (in quadratic time\martin{is that true, maybe we omit this claim.}).  Now define the $S$ extensions of
an annotated model $\MMM$ as all models which extend the states of
$\MMM$ with extra transitions taken from $S$ which respect the state
labelling on $\MMM$.  Now $\phi_i \models \psi$ if and only if all
$S$-extensions\martin{What is that?} of $\SIMPL{\phi_i}$ satisfy $\psi$.  So, to check
whether $\phi_i \models \psi$, we enumerate the $S$-extensions of
$\SIMPL{\phi_i}$ (there are a finite number of such extensions - the
exact number is exponential in the size of $\SIMPL{\phi_i}$) and check
for each one whether it satisfies $\psi$.

To fill out this sketch, we will describe the structure of the
annotated model, define the $\mu$\martin{THe $\mu$ function doesn't appearto occur elsewhere.} function, and show how to compute
the extensions of an annotated model relative to a set $S$ of symbols.


\subsection{Computing the Extensions of a Model}

\martin{Maybe merge this subsection with the previous.}

Since to check whether $\phi_i \models \psi$, we enumerate the
$S$-extensions of $\SIMPL{\phi_i}$ (there are a finite number of such
extensions - the exact number is exponential in the size of
$\SIMPL{\phi_i}$) and check for each one whether it satisfies $\psi$.

\begin{definition}
Given an cathoristic transition system $(\mathcal{W},\rightarrow,\lambda)$,  and a set $S$ of symbols, then $(\mathcal{W'},\rightarrow',\lambda')$ is a {\bf $S$-extension} of $(\mathcal{W},\rightarrow,\lambda)$ if it is a valid LTS (recall Definition 1) and for all $(x,a,y) \in \rightarrow'$, either:
\begin{itemize} 
\item
$(x, a, y) \in \rightarrow$,  or;
\item
 $x \in \mathcal{W}$ and $a \in S$ and $y$ is a new state not appearing elsewhere in $\mathcal{W}$ or $\mathcal{W'}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
In other words, $\MMM'$ is an extension of an annotated model $\MMM$, if all its transitions are either from $\MMM$ or involve states of $\MMM$ transitioning via elements of $S$ to new states not appearing in $\MMM$ or $\MMM'$.

The number of extensions can quickly grow very large.
If the model $\MMM$ has $n$ states, then the number of possible extensions is:
\[
({2^{|S|}})^n
\] 
But recall that we are computing these extensions in order to verify $\psi$. So we can make a significant optimisation by restricting the height of each tree to $|\psi|$.
