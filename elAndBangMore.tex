\section{A decision procedure for eremic logic}\label{decisionprocedure}

In Section \ref{coreEL} we presented \ELABR{} and established the key
properties of completeness and compactness.  Here we give a
linear-time decision procedure.  The linear time-complexity of the
decision procedure is an indication that \ELABR{} can be useful as a
query language in knowledge representation. 

\NI Since \ELABR{} has no connectives for disjunction or implication, its
decision procedure is straightforward and efficient.  Although there
are an infinite number of models which satisfy any expression, the
satisfying models form a lattice with a least upper bound.  The $\SIMPL$
function defined above gives us the minimal model satisfying an
expression.  Using this least upper bound, we can calculate entailment
by checking a \emph{single model}.  To decide whether $p \models q$,
we use the following theorem:

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:decision}
  The following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item\label{theorem:decision:1} For all eremic models $\MMM$,
      $\MMM \models \phi$ implies $\MMM \models \psi$.
    \item\label{theorem:decision:2} $\SIMPL{\phi} \models \psi$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The implication from  (\ref{theorem:decision:1}) to
(\ref{theorem:decision:2}) is trivial because $\SIMPL{\phi}$ is a model by construction.

For the reverse direction, assume $\MMM \models \phi$. We need to show
$\MMM \models \psi$.  Now if $\MMM \models \phi$ then $\MMM \MODELLEQ
\SIMPL{\phi}$ (by Lemma \ref{...}).  Further, if $\MMM' \models \xi $
and $\MMM \MODELLEQ \MMM'$ then $\MMM \models \xi $ by Theorem
\ref{completeLattice}. So, substituting $\psi$ for $\xi $ and
$\SIMPL{\phi}$ for $\MMM'$, it follows that $\MMM \models \psi$.
\end{proof}

\NI Given this theorem, the decision procedure is straightforward: to
test if $\phi \models \psi$, we construct $\SIMPL{\phi}$, and then inspect whether
$\SIMPL{\phi} \models \psi$.  Construction of $\SIMPL{\phi}$ is linear in the size of
$\phi$, and computing whether a model satisfies $\psi$ is linear in the size
of $\psi$, so computing whether $\phi \models \psi$ is $O(|\phi|+|\psi|)$.

  about Haskell code?}
