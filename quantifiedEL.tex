\section{Quantified EL}

We can add variables and quantifiers to EL in the usual way.
\begin{definition} 
Let $\Sigma$ be a non-empty set of actions, ranged over by $a, a', ...$ as before, and let $A$ range over
finite subsets of $\Sigma$. 
Given a set $\mathcal{V}$ of \emph{variables},
with $X, X', Y, Y', ...$ ranging over $\mathcal{V}$, the formulae of QEL are given by the
following grammar:

\begin{GRAMMAR}
  \phi 
     &\quad ::= \quad & 
  \TRUE 
     \VERTICAL 
  \phi \AND \psi
     \VERTICAL 
  \MAY{a}{\phi}
     \VERTICAL 
  \MAY{X}{\phi}
     \VERTICAL 
  \fBang A 
     \VERTICAL 
  \exists X . {\phi}
     \VERTICAL 
  \forall X . {\phi}
\end{GRAMMAR}
\end{definition}
In QEL, we can say that there is exactly one king of France, and he is bald, as:
\[
\exists X . \MAY{king} \MAY{france} ! \{X\} \land \MAY{X} \MAY{bald}
\]
Expressing this in predicate logic is significantly more cumbersome:
\[
\exists X. king(france, X) \land bald(X) \land \forall Y. king(france, Y) \rightarrow Y = X
\]
The predicate logic version uses an extra universal quantifier, and also requires the identity relation (which itself requires the schema of the Indiscernibility of Identicals ).

To say that every person has exactly one sex, which is either male or female, we can write in QEL:
\[
\forall X . \MAY{X} \MAY{person} \rightarrow \MAY{X} \MAY{sex} ! \{male, female\} \land \exists Y . \MAY{X} \MAY{sex} (\MAY{Y} \land \fBang \{Y\})
\]
This is significantly more elegant than the equivalent in predicate logic:
\[
\forall X. person(X) \rightarrow \exists Y . sex(X,Y) \land (Y = male \; \lor \; Y = female) \land \forall Z . sex(X,Z) \rightarrow Y = Z
\]

To say that every traffic light is coloured either green, amber or red, we can write in QEL:
\[
\forall X. \MAY{X} \MAY{light} \rightarrow \MAY{X} \MAY{colour} !\{green, amber, red\} \land \exists Y . \MAY{X} \MAY{colour} (\MAY{Y} \land !\{Y\})
\]
Again, this is significantly less verbose than the equivalent in predicate logic:
\[
\forall X. light(X) \rightarrow \exists Y . colour(X,Y) \land (Y = green \; \lor \; Y = amber \; \lor \; Y = red) \land \forall Z . colour(X,Z) \rightarrow Y = Z
\]
