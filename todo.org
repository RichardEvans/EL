* Be consistent. In particular
  - State vs node

  - Make sure always to be precise about eremic model vs eremic
    transition system

  - POV vs point of view vs point-of-view

  - LTS vs labelled transition system

  - FOL vs first-order logic, EL vs eremic logic

  - Either all definitions are in an explicit \begin{definition}
    environment or none.

  - Term defined should always be \textbf{...} or \textsc{...} etc.

  - FOrmulae vs terms vs sentences

  - What kind of space ! puts between itself and its set. and also before !

  - Book titles always in \emph, e.g. \emph{Philosophical Remarks}?

  - capitalisation, e.g. Eremic Logic vs Eremic logic vs eremic logic etc.

* Talk about binding and precedence in EL formulae.
* Find better names for fragments: e.g. EL[∧, !] isn't exactly snappy. What
about Core etc?
* Make sure we have \qed at the end of every proof. Better:
  put it into the latex macro.

* Put a full stop after \proof
* Say what ranges over what, e.g. \frac{M} over models, X, Y over
  formulae, etc.  Be consistent about this.

* Use descriptive names, why \mu(X) for the simplest model satisfying
  $X$?  would not simp(X) or something like that more readable?

* Finalise the name of the logic. I am going to check with my friend
  Tim Whitmarsh one more time that "Eremic Logic" is the best name for
  it.

* Find a better name for !A than "bang A".
About the question how to name !A I think the obvious names are
something like this:

   Just A
   Only A
   Nothing but A
   Solely A 

Whatever we choose, we should also have a scientific sounding term
that relates to !  as conjunction relates to /\ as well as disjunction
to \/.  In Latin we can choose tantum, nisi, solo, solus and in Greek:
mono (μόνο). If we go creative we could simply say

   Erem A

*  I recommend to use the following order of presentation in Chapters 2 and 3.

  - Formulae
  - Models and the satisfaction relation.
  - Rules and axioms
  - Soundness of rules and axioms
  - Completeness of rules and axioms
  - Other stuff (Translation into FOL, decision procedure etc).

  I think it might also help if we relegate standard proofs to the
  appendix.  For example we could just state the soundness theorem in
  the main body of the paper, prove 2 or 3 interesting cases, and have
  the rest in the appendix. I also prefer it if ther proof rules are
  all in one figure, rather than distributed over a couple of pages.

  - Rules and axioms in figures.

  - Easy proof go in the appendix

* Give more examples.

* be consistent on capitalisation.

* Timetable: 13.May to 16.May, can we finish it?

* Find possible reviewers (please add more):

* Could it make sense to prepare a little video presentation (using
  Screenflow, or recording professionally), maybe 15 minutes, to
  introduce the material? This could make it more accessible to
  non-technical audiences.)

* Prepare Haskell decision procedure. Put on Github. Write
  instructions on how to use.

* THink about how to interface the paper with Versu.  Versu—A
  Simulationist Storytelling System

* Think about seminars (Sussex, Imperial, Oxford, QMUL which others?)

* Related work: 

  - Investgations into negation
  - Philosophical stuff
  - Logics for knowledge representation
  - Standard Modal Logic stuff
  - HM Logic
  - Linear logic (additive conjunction)

* The rule (! left) is not used in the completeness proof. Why not?
* go through old emails and list ideas and issues that we discussed
* Remove all commented out LaTeX including macros.
