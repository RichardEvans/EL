* TODO spell-check everything, first MB then RPE
* DONE Be clear about tantum and available vs permitted:

Now we are describing the tantrum !A as giving the *available* actions.
But that's wrong. It gives the *permitted* actions.

Ask all these people: who else could be interested,
were they recommend it could be published, if they have
suggestions for related work we forgot to mention.

- where to submit
- where to give a seminar (are they interested)?
- Can they think of related work?
- Can they think of others who would be interested in this work
- Technically recommendations? or recommendations regarding the presentation?

to use "formula" when we speak about anything formal, and sentence
when we talk about natural language. No use of term. But I'm not 100%
sure about it. For example in the abstract we write 

   \Cathoristic{} is a multi-modal logic where negation is replaced by
   a novel operator allowing the expression of incompatible sentences.

Would 

   \Cathoristic{} is a multi-modal logic where negation is replaced by
   a novel operator allowing the expression of incompatible formualae.

Be an adequate rendition too? 
We decided to drop term and not do anything about formula/sentence for the time being.

** TODO Book titles always in \emph, e.g. \emph{Philosophical Remarks}?

* DONE Don't display \subsubsections in table of content
* DONE Make references to versu in biblio OK
* DONE Set up own github repo for Haskell code, put in proper references.
* TODO Put in license and documentation (sparse) for Haskell code in repo
* TODO Here is something we can do (not now but soon): 
create a set of slides and a little video presentation (using
  Screenflow), maybe 15 minutes, to introduce the material to
  non-experts, and put it on our webpages? This makes the material
  more accessible and is help to disseminate the paper. People much
  rather watch a video than read a paper.  Also the 15 minute time
  limit and choice of medium severely constraints us in what we can
  say, so we must focus on the essentials. )

[17/06/2014 17:11:34] Martin Berger: or Translating from cathoristic  to first-order logic
[17/06/2014 17:11:43] Richard Evans: I think I marginally prefer the second

* DONE Prove  Haskell decisoin proce compexity is quadratic
* DONE Prove general completenss
* DONE Explain the meaning of "Cathoristic".
* DONE Too many of our sentences start with "But ..." Is this elegant?
* DONE IGNORE for now Make a clear point somewhere that tree models are
all we need.

This is a general insight that holds for all modal logics, and
is the case becasue bisimulation can't distinguish between LTS and their
tree unflodings. 

If we put this in, we can probably clean up some stuff.
* DONE Explain genesis of Brandom in
\footnote{Itself a development of Sellars,
  Hegel and Kant.}
* DONE Add all missing biblographic references
* DONE remove doubly defined labels, add missing labels
* DONE Ignore: Cases in proofs are inconsistent across the paper
* DONE Each chapter its own file
* DONE Ignore remove all files that are not used 
* DONE IGNORE Maybe we should call "pure cathoristic" models just "pure" models?
* DONE Ignore Have we discussed bisimulation invariance?
* DONE Talk about binding and precedence in EL formulae, qunatifiers etc. Be consistent.
* DONE Find better names for fragments: e.g. EL[∧, !] isn't exactly snappy. What
about Core etc?
* DONE If we remove [!-Left] from the rules, then prove it as a lemma
  or use it as an example of derivable rules.
* DONE Explain the terms "cathoristic" and "tantum" (if we stick with them)
* DONE Should we have a section about material incompatibility and how
  Gamma |- phi iff Gamma, not phi inconsistent does not hold in EL?
* DONE Factor out the stuff that I use in compactness by translation and Richard
  in the theorem that states "If a formula φ is satisfiable, then
  there is a finite tree-like model of height |φ| and branching factor
  σ(φ) that satisfies φ."
  I mean the stuff about erasing superfluous labels.
* DONE Make sure we have \qed at the end of every proof. Better:
  put it into the latex macro.

* Make sure figures look coherent, and live in suitable places.
* DONE IGNORE for now Remove macros that are not used.
* DONE Put a full stop after \proof
* DONE Since most (all) examples don't use the change over time
of the structure of exclusion, we have an even more basic 
fragment where all !A is not under a may. (Or something like
that.) Discuss and investigate
* DONE Ask philosophers about historical precursors for using exlusion
  to approach human language
* DONE Say what ranges over what, e.g. \frac{M} over models, X, Y over
  formulae, etc.  Be consistent about this.

* DONE Use descriptive names, why \mu(X) for the simplest model satisfying
  $X$?  would not simp(X) or something like that more readable?

* DONE EL allows us to do  intra-atomic inferences that are not possible in FOL.
But are we capturing all intra-atomic inferences or is EL missing
some? What is the expressivity of EL? This question might not have
a clear answer but it might be worthwhile considering.
* DONE Finalise the name of the logic. I am going to check with my friendy
  Tim Whitmarsh one more time that "Cathoristic Logic" is the best name for
  it.
* DONE Find a better name for !A than "bang A".
About the question how to name !A I think the obvious names are
something like this:

   Just A
   Only A
   Nothing but A
   Solely A 
   At most

Whatever we choose, we should also have a scientific sounding term
that relates to !  as conjunction relates to /\ as well as disjunction
to \/.  In Latin we can choose tantum, nisi, solo, solus and in Greek:
mono (μόνο). If we go creative we could simply say

   Erem A
* DONE Ignore for nodw What about the dual "at least A" operator? We should have a discussion.
* DONE Given the size of the paper, maybe we can have a table of content and/or
  an index?
* DONE Do when we get feedback Add generous acknowledgements (in particular if we get feedback from others)
* DONE What about quantification over actions? Section 11 just quantifies over individuals.
* DONE Should we have proof in the appendix at all?
* DONE I recommend to use the following order of presentation in Chapters 2 and 3.

  - Formulae
  - Models and the satisfaction relation.
  - Rules and axioms
  - Soundness of rules and axioms
  - Completeness of rules and axioms
  - Other stuff (Translation into FOL, decision procedure etc).

  I think it might also help if we relegate standard proofs to the
  appendix.  For example we could just state the soundness theorem in
  the main body of the paper, prove 2 or 3 interesting cases, and have
  the rest in the appendix. I also prefer it if ther proof rules are
  all in one figure, rather than distributed over a couple of pages.

  - Rules and axioms in figures.

  - Easy proof go in the appendix

* DONE Give more examples.
OD
* DONE be consistent on capitalisation.

* DONE Timetable :13.May to 16.May, can we finish it?

* DONE Related work: 

  - Investgations into negation
  - Philosophical stuff
  - Logics for knowledge representation
  - Standard Modal Logic stuff
  - HM Logic
  - Linear logic (additive conjunction)

* DONE The rule (! left) is not used in the completeness proof. Why not?
* DONE go through old emails and list ideas and issues that we discussed
* DONE Later Remove all commented out LaTeX including macros.
* DONE Put the footnote on complexity of binders in main intro body.
add later something about how this is reflected in EL queries.

   Yes. (We currently use one-way pattern matching rather than
   unification).  When inserting a statement in a database based on
   FOPL (e.g. inserting the statement that the traffic light is
   green), the inference engine has to make forward-chaining
   inferences to see which statements to delete (e.g. it needs to use
   your FOPL rules for traffic lights only being one colour to infer
   that the traffic light is no longer orange).  But in EL, the
   removal of incompatible propositions happens without the need for
   inference over universally quantified propositions. We can see
   directly from the node labelling of the current node which
   statements can no longer be true.
* DONE Make references and links clickable (This seems to cause a problem with the springer latex style)
