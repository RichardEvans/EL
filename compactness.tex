\subsection{Compactness}

\NI First-order logic has compactness: a set $S$ of sentences has a
model exactly when every finite subset of $S$ does \cite[Chapter
  4.3]{EndertonHB:matinttl}. What about eremic logic? 

We can prove compactness of modal logics using the standard
translation from modal to first-order logic \cite{BlackburnP:modlog}:
we assume that we have a set of modal formula such that each finite
subset has a model. We translate the modal formulae and models to
first-order logic, getting a set of formulae such that each finite
subset has a first-order model by compactness of first-order
logic. Then we translate the first-order model back to modal logic,
obtaining a model for all modal formulae, as required.

Unfortunately we cannot do the same with the translation from eremic
to first-order logic presented in the previous section. The problem
are the first-order models termed 'junk' above: they do not correspond
to eremic transistion systems.  For example the constraint $s
\TRANS{a} t$ implies $a \in \lambda(s)$ might be violated. After all,
merely having signature $\SSS$ is not strong enough a constraint. The
target language of the translation from the previous section is not
expressive enough to express such constraints.  As we have no reason
to belive that the first-order model whose existence is guarnateed by
compactness isn't 'junk', we cannot use this translation.

We solve this problem with a second translation from eremic to
first-order logic, this time into a more expressive fragment were we
can constrain first-order models enough to ensure that they always can
be translated back to eremic logic.

The second embedding translates eremic logic to two-sorted first-order
logic. The many-sorted first-order signature $\SSS'$ has two sorts,
states and actions. It has a nullary predicate $\top$, an binary
predicate $\ALLOWED{}{\cdot}{\cdot}$ and a ternary predicate
$\ARROWTWO{}{\cdot}{\cdot}{\cdot}$. The intended interpretation
should should be clear.

With the target logic in place, we can now present a second encoding
$\SEMBTWO{\phi}_x$ of eremic formulae.

\begin{eqnarray*}
  \SEMBTWO{\top}_x & \ = \ & \top
     \\
  \SEMBTWO{\phi \AND \psi}_x & = & \SEMBTWO{\phi}_x \AND \SEMBTWO{\psi}_x
     \\
  \SEMBTWO{\langle a \rangle \phi}_x & = & \exists^{S} y.(\ARROW{a}{x}{y} \AND \SEMBTWO{\phi}_y)
     \\
  \SEMBTWO{\fBang A}_x & = & \forall^{\Sigma} a.(\ALLOWED{}{x}{a} \IMPLIES a \in A) 
\end{eqnarray*}

\NI Here we use $\exists^{S}$ to indicate that the quantifier ranges
of the sort of states, and $\forall^{\Sigma}$ for a quantifier ranging
over actions. The expression $a \in A$ is a shorthand for the
first-order formula
\[
   a = a_1 \OR a = a_2 \OR \cdots \OR a = a_n
\]
assuming that $A = \{a_1, ..., a_n\}$.

Note that the translation above could be restricted to a two-variable
fragment. Moreover, the standard reduction from many-sorted to
one-sorted first-order logic, does not increase the number of
variables used (although predicates are added, one per sort)
\cite{EndertonHB:matinttl}. For simplicity we will not consider this
matter further.

Before we can state and prove a correspondence theorem for
$\SEMBTWO{\phi}_x$ along the lines of Theorem
\ref{correspondence:theorem:1}, we must also translate eremic
  transition systems $\SEMBTWO{\LLL}$.

\begin{definition}
Let $\LLL = (S, \rightarrow, \lambda)$ be an eremic transition
system. Clearly $\LLL$ gives rise to an $\SSS'$-model $\SEMBTWO{\LLL}$
as follows.
\begin{itemize}

\item The sort of states is interpreted by the set $S$.

\item The sort of states is interpreted by the set $\Sigma$.

\item The relation symbols are interpreted as follows.

  \begin{itemize}

    \item $\top^{\SEMBTWO{\LLL}}$ always holds.

    \item $\ALLOWED{\SEMBTWO{\LLL}}{s}{a}$ holds whenever $a \in \lambda(s)$.

    \item $\ARROWTWO{\SEMBTWO{\LLL}}{s}{a}{t}$ holds whenver $s \TRANS{a} t$.

  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}


\begin{theorem}[correspondence theorem]\label{correspondence:theorem:2}
Let $\phi$ be an eremic formula and $\MMM = (\LLL, s)$ an eremic
model.
\[
   \MMM \models \phi \quad  \text{iff} \quad \SEMBTWO{\LLL} \models_{x \mapsto s} \SEMBTWO{\phi}_x.
\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds by induction on the structure of $\phi$ and is
similar to that of Theorem \ref{correspondence:theorem:2}.  \qed
\end{proof}

\NI We now use the translation $\SEMBTWO{\phi}_x$ to show that eremic
logic must also have compactness. The key steps in the proof are
simple, following standard techniques from modal logic
\cite{BlackburnP:modlog}:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Choose a set $T$ of eremic formulae, such that each finite
  subset $T'$ of $T$ has an eremic model $(\LLL, s)$.

\item Using the translations gives a set $\SEMBTWO{T} =
  \{\SEMBTWO{\phi}\ |\ \phi \in T\}$ of first-order formulae such that
  each finite subset has a first-order model $\SEMBTWO{\LLL}$.

\item By compactness of first-order logic, we can find a first-order
  model $\CAL{M}$ of $\SEMBTWO{T}$.

\item\label{compactness:step:4} Convert $\CAL{M}$ into an eremic transition system
  $\CAL{M}^{\sharp}$ such that $(\CAL{M}^{\sharp}, s) \models T$.

\end{enumerate}

\NI The problematic step is (\ref{compactness:step:4}), for how would
we know that the model $\CAL{M}$ can be converted back to an eremic
transition system? Why should $\CAL{M}$ exhibit admissibility or
well-sizedness?  The mere fact that $\CAL{M}$ is a first-order model
of signature $\SSS'$ is not strong enough to guarantee these
properties.  We deal with this in two ways. To ensure admissibility,
we define a formula that guarantees that models satisfying the formula
are admissible.
\[
   \phi_{admis} 
      \ =\ 
   \forall^{S} s.\forall^{\Sigma} a.\forall^{S} t.( \ARROWTWO{}{s}{a}{t} \IMPLIES \ALLOWED{}{s}{a})
\]

\begin{lemma}\label{compactness:lemma:233}
If $\LLL$ is an eremic transistion system then $\SEMBTWO{\LLL} \models
\phi_{admis}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Straightforward from the definitions.
\qed
\end{proof}

\NI We can now add, without changing satisfiability, $\phi_{admis}$ to
any set of first-order formulae that has a model that is the
translation of an eremic model.

We deal with the absence of well-sizedness by 

\begin{definition}
Let $\CAL{M}$ be a first-order model for the signature $\SSS'$. 
We construct an eremic transition system
$\CAL{M}^{\sharp} = (S, \rightarrow, \lambda)$.

\begin{itemize}

\item The states $V$ are given by the $\MMM$ interpretation of states.

\item The reduction relation $s \TRANS{\alpha} t$ holds exactly when
  $\mathsf{Arrow}^{\CAL{M}}_a(x, y)$ is true.

\item The function $\lambda$ is given by the following clause:
  $\lambda(s) = A$ exactly when $\mathsf{Restrict}_{A}^{\CAL{M}}(x)$
  holds.

\end{itemize}

\end{definition}

\martin{The constructions of $\SEMB{\LLL}$ and $\CAL{M}^{\sharp}$ are
  kind of trivial.  Do we need to spell them out explicitly?}

\begin{proof}
By induction on the structure of $\phi$. The cases $\top$ and $\phi_1
\AND \phi_2$ are straightfoward. For (\ref{correspondence:theorem:1})
the case $\MAY{a}\psi$ is handeled as follows.
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \lefteqn{
  \SEMB{\LLL} \models_{x \mapsto s} \SEMB{\MAY{a}\psi}_x}\hspace{5mm} 
     \\

     &\text{iff}&
  \text{exists}\ t \in S. \SEMB{\LLL} \models_{x \mapsto s, y \mapsto t} \ARROW{a}{x}{y} \ \text{and}\ \SEMB{\LLL} \models_{x \mapsto s, y \mapsto t}  \SEMB{\psi}_y
     \\

  \text{exists}\ t \in S. s \TRANS{a} t \ \text{and}\ \SEMB{\LLL} \models_{x \mapsto s, y \mapsto t}  \SEMB{\psi}_y
     \\
     &\text{iff}&
  \text{exists}\ t \in S. s \TRANS{a} t \ \text{and}\ \SEMB{\LLL} \models_{y \mapsto t}  \SEMB{\psi}_y \qquad (\text{as $x$ is not free in $\psi$})
     \\
     &\text{iff}&
  \text{exists}\ t \in S. s \TRANS{a} t \ \text{and}\ \MMM \models \psi
     \\
     &\text{iff}&
  \MMM \models \MAY{a}\psi  
\end{eqnarray*}

\NI Finally, if $\phi$ is $!A$ the derivation comes straight from the definitions.
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \SEMB{\LLL} \models_{x \mapsto s} \SEMB{!A}_x
    &\quad \text{iff}\quad &
  \SEMB{\LLL} \models_{x \mapsto s} \RESTRICT{A}{x}
     \\
     &\text{iff}&
  \lambda(s) \subseteq A
     \\
     &\text{iff}&
  \MMM \models\ !A.
\end{eqnarray*}

\NI This concludes the proof for (\ref{correspondence:theorem:1}).
The derivation for (\ref{correspondence:theorem:2}) is similar and
omitted.
\end{proof}
\martin{The proof is too trivial, move to appendix.}


\martin{do we need to keep the lemma below?}
\begin{lemma}\label{modelIso:lemma}
For all $\SSS$-models $\CAL{M}$: $\SEMB{\CAL{M}^{\sharp}} = \CAL{M}$.
Likewise, for all eremic models $\MMM$: 
 $\SEMB{\MMM}^{\sharp} = \MMM$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
To do.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
Let $T$ be a set of eremic formulae, and $\MMM$ an eremic model.  We
write $\MMM \models T$ provided $\MMM \models \phi$ for all $\phi \in
T$.  We say $T$ is \emph{satisfiable} provided $\MMM \models T$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Compactness of eremic logic]
A set $T$ of eremic formulae is satisfiable iff each finite subset of
$T$ is satisfiable.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
For the non-trivial direction, let $T$ be a set of eremic formulae.
For any finite subset $T'$ of $T$, assume that $T'$ is satisfiable.
Hence an eremic model $\MMM = (\LLL, s)$ exists such that
\[
   \MMM \models T'
\]
Hence 
\[
   \MMM \models \phi
\]
for each $\phi \in T'$. By Theorem \ref{correspondence:theorem}.\ref{correspondence:theorem:1} we know that
\[
   \SEMB{\MMM} \models_{x \mapsto s} \SEMB{\phi}_x.
\]
for all appropriate $\phi$. Hence the set 
\[
   \{ \SEMB{\phi}_x\ |\ \phi \in T'\}
\]
of first-order formulae has a first-order model for all finite $T'$.
By compactness of first-order logic we thus know that the set
\[
   \{ \SEMB{\phi}_x\ |\ \phi \in T\}
\]
has a first-order model $\CAL{M}$. Hence for all $\phi \in T$:
\[
   \CAL{M} \models_{x \mapsto s} \SEMB{\phi}_x
\]
Using Theorem
\ref{correspondence:theorem}.\ref{correspondence:theorem:2}, we
conclude that
\[
   (\CAL{M}^{\sharp}, s) \models \phi
\]
for all $\phi \in T$. In other words:
\[
   (\CAL{M}^{\sharp}, s) \models T
\]
and $T$ is satisfiable.
\end{proof}
