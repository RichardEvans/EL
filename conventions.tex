\section{Stylistic conventions}

It is very helpful for the reader if variables names give some
indication about what they range over, e.g. a set $S$ is ranged over
by $s, s', s_1, s_2, ...$ etc.  It is also very helpful to be very
consistent in this regard.  This section proposes some such
conventions. The section will be removed before submission.

\begin{itemize}

\item Formulae  are ranged over by $\phi, \psi$ etc.
\item Integers are ranged over by $i, j, m, n, ...$ etc.
\item States are ranged over by $s, s', t, ...$ etc.
\item Actions are ranged over by $a, a', b, ...$ etc.
\item Simulations and bisimulations are ranged over by $\RRR$ etc.
\item LTS are ranged over by $\CAL{L}, ...$ etc.
\item Models are ranged over by $\FRAK{M}, ...$ etc.

\end{itemize}
