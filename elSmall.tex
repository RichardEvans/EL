\section{\Cathoristic{}}\label{coreEL}

In this section we introduce the syntax and semantics of \cathoristic{}.

\subsection{Syntax}
\label{elsyntax}
\NI Syntactically, \cathoristic{} is a multi-modal logic with one new
operator.

\begin{definition} Let $\Sigma$ be a non-empty set of \emph{actions}.
Actions are ranged over by $a, a', a_1, b, ...$, and $A$ ranges over
finite subsets of $\Sigma$. The \emph{formulae}, ranged over by $\phi,
\psi, \xi ...$, of \cathoristic{} are given by the
following grammar.

\begin{GRAMMAR}
  \phi 
     &\quad ::= \quad & 
  \TRUE 
     \VERTICAL 
  \phi \AND \psi
     \VERTICAL 
  \MAY{a}{\phi}
     \VERTICAL 
  \fBang A 
\end{GRAMMAR}
\end{definition}

\NI Before presenting models and the satisfaction relation, we sketch
the meaning of formulae informally. $\TRUE$ is truth and $\phi \AND
\psi$ is the conjunction of formulae $\phi$ and $\psi$. Clearly
$\MAY{a}{\phi}$ is a may-modality which asserts that the current state
can do action $a$, and in doing $a$ evolves into a new state at which
$\phi$ holds. Tantum $A$, from Latin ``tantum'' meaning ``only'' and
written $!A$, is the key novelty of \cathoristic{}.  Asserting $!A$
means: in the current state at most the modalities $\MAY{a}{}$ are
available that satisfy $a \in A$.  The set $\Sigma$ of actions must be
non-empty to avoid that the logic is trivial. 

We assume that $\MAY{a}{\phi}$ binds more tightly than conjunction, so
$\MAY{a}{\phi} \AND \psi$ is short for $(\MAY{a}{\phi}) \AND \psi$.
We often abbreviate $\MAY{a}{\TRUE}$ to $\MAY{a}{}$. We define falsity
$\FALSE$ as $!\emptyset \AND \MAY{a}{}$ where $a$ is an arbitrary
action. Note that in the absence of conventional negation, we cannot
readily define disjunction, implication, or must-modalities by de
Morgan duality. 

\begin{convention}
From now on we assume a fixed set $\Sigma$ of actions, except where
stated otherwise.
\end{convention}

\subsection{Semantics}

\NI The semantics of \cathoristic{} is close to Hennessy-Milner logic
\cite{HennessyM:alglawfndac} but uses \emph{deterministic} transition
systems (cf.~Section \ref{preliminaries}) augmented with labels on
states.

%% \begin{definition}

%% \NI We say $\LLL$ is \emph{deterministic} if $x \TRANS{a} y$ and $x \TRANS{a} z$ imply that $y = z$. Otherwise $\LLL$ is
%% \emph{non-deterministic}.
%% \end{definition}

\begin{definition}
An \emph{cathoristic transition system} is a triple $\LLL = (S,
\rightarrow, \lambda)$, where $(S, \rightarrow)$ is a deterministic
labelled transition system over $\Sigma$, and $\lambda$ is a function
from states to sets of actions (not necessarily finite), subject to
the following constraints:
\begin{itemize}

\item For all states $s \in S$ it is the case that $ \{a \fOr \exists
  t \; s \xrightarrow{a} t\} \subseteq \lambda(s)$. We call this
  condition \emph{admissibility}.

\item For all states $s \in S$, $\lambda (s)$ is either finite or
  $\Sigma$. We call this condition \emph{well-sizedness}.

\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\NI The intended interpretation is that $\lambda(w)$ is the set of
allowed transition symbols emanating from $w$.  The $\lambda$ function
is the semantic counterpart of the $!$ operator.  The admissibility
restriction is in place because transitions $s \TRANS{a} t$ where $a
\notin \lambda(s)$ would be saying that an $a$ action is possible at
$s$ but at the same time prohibit $a$ actions at that state.
Well-sizedness is not a fundamental restriction but rather a
convenient trick. Essentially cathoristic transition systems have two kinds
of nodes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Nodes $s$ without restrictions on outgoing transitions. Those are
  labelled with $\lambda ( s) = \Sigma$.

\item Nodes $s$ with restriction on outgoing transitions. Those are
  labelled by a finite set $\lambda ( s)$ of actions.

\end{itemize}

\NI Defining $\lambda$ on all nodes and not just on those with
restrictions makes some definitions and proofs slightly easier.

As with other modal logics, satisfaction of formulae is defined
relative to a state in the ambient cathoristic transition system, giving
rise to the following definition.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{cathoristic model}, ranged over by $\MMM, \MMM', ...$, is a
pair $(\LLL, s)$, where $\LLL$ is an cathoristic transition system
$(S, \rightarrow, \lambda)$, and $s$ is a state from $S$. We call $s$
the \emph{start state} of the model.  An cathoristic model with start
state $s$ is a \emph{tree} if the underlying transition system is a
tree with start state $s$.
\end{definition}

\NI With cathoristic models at hand, we can finally formalise the
satisfaction relation for cathoristic formulae.

\begin{definition}\label{ELsatisfaction}
The \emph{satisfaction relation} $\MMM \models \phi$ is defined
inductively by the following clauses, where we assume that $\MMM =
(\LLL, s)$ and $\LLL = (S, \rightarrow, \lambda)$.
\[
\begin{array}{lclcl}
  \MMM & \models & \top   \\
  \MMM & \models & \phi \AND \psi &\ \mbox{ iff } \ & \MMM  \models \phi \mbox { and } \MMM \models \psi  \\
  \MMM & \models & \langle a \rangle \phi & \mbox{ iff } & \text{there is transition } s \xrightarrow{a} t \mbox { such that } (\LLL, t) \models \phi  \\
  \MMM & \models & \fBang A &\mbox{ iff } & \lambda(s) \subseteq A
\end{array}
\]
\end{definition}

\NI The first three clauses are standard. The last clause enforces the
intended meaning of $!A$: the available modalities in the model are
\emph{at least as constrained} as required by $!A$. They may even be
more constrained if the inclusion $\lambda(s) \subseteq A$ is
proper. For infinite sets $\Sigma$ of actions, allowing $\lambda(s)$
to return arbitrary inifinite sets in addition to $\sigma$ does not
make a difference because $A$ is finite by construction, so
$\lambda(s) \subseteq A$ can never hold anyway for infinite
$\lambda(s)$.

\input{figure:elSmall}

We continue with concrete examples.  The model in Figure
\ref{figure:elSmall} satisfies all the following formulae, amongst
others:
\[
\begin{array}{lclclclcl}
\MAY{a} &\qquad&
\MAY{a} \MAY{b} &\qquad&
\MAY{a} \fBang \{b,c\} &\qquad&
\MAY{a} \fBang \{b,c,d\} &\qquad&
\MAY{c} \\[1mm]
\MAY{c} \fBang \{\} &&
\MAY{c} \fBang \{a\} &&
\MAY{c} \fBang \{a,b\} &&
\MAY{a} \land \MAY{c} &&
\MAY{a} (\MAY{b} \land \fBang \{b,c\}
\end{array}
\]

\NI Here we assume, as we do with all subsequent such figures, that
the top note is the start state.  The same model does not satisfy any
of the following formulae
\[
\MAY{b} \qquad
\fBang \{a\} \qquad
\fBang \{a, c\} \qquad
\MAY{a} \fBang \{b\} \qquad
\MAY{a} \MAY{c} \qquad
\MAY{a} \MAY{b} \fBang \{c\} 
\]

\NI Figure \ref{threemodels} shows various models of $\MAY{a} \MAY{b}$
and Figure \ref{more models} shows one model that does, and one that
does not, satisfy the formula $\fBang \{a,b\}$.  Both models validate
$!\{a, b, c\}$.

\Cathoristic{} does not have the operators $\neg, \lor, $ or
$\Rightarrow$.  This has the following two signification consequences.
First, every satisfiable formula has a unique (up to isomorphism)
simplest model.  In Figure \ref{threemodels}, the left model is the
unique simplest model satisfying$\MAY{a} \MAY{b}$.  We will clarify
below that model simplicity is closely related to the process
theoretic concept of similarity, and use the existence of unique
simplest models to construct a quadratic-time decision procedure.

Secondly, EL is different from other logics in that there is an
asymmetry between tautologies and contradictories: logics with
conventional negation have an infinite number of non-trivial
tautologies as well as an infinite number of contradictories.  In
contrast, because \cathoristic{} has no negation or disjunction
operator, it is expressively limited in the tautologies it can
express: top and conjunctions of top are its sole tautologies. On the
other hand, the tantum operator, enables an infinite number of
contradictories to be expressed.  For example:
\[
   \MAY{a} \land \fBang \{\} \qquad
   \MAY{a} \land \fBang \{b\} \qquad
   \MAY{a} \land \fBang \{b, c\} \qquad
   \MAY{b} \land \fBang \{\} \qquad
\]


%% \begin{definition} Let $\Gamma$ be an arbitrary set of formulae. We
%% say \emph{$\Gamma$ semantically implies $\phi$}, written $\Gamma
%% \models \phi$, provided for all cathoristic models $\MMM$ if it is the
%% case that $\MMM \models \Gamma$ implies $\MMM \models \phi$.
%% \richard{We do not define $\models \Gamma$ for a set $\Gamma$, only
%% for individual formulae - do we want to change this definition to
%% be of the form $\phi \models \psi$?}  \end{definition}

\NI Now we present the semantic consequence relation
.
\begin{definition} 
 We say the formula $\phi$ \emph{semantically implies} $\psi$, written $\phi
   \models \psi$, provided for all cathoristic models $\MMM$ if it is the
   case that $\MMM \models \phi$ then also $\MMM \models \phi$.
   We sometimes write $\models \phi$ as a shorthand for $\top \models \phi$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
\Cathoristic{} shares with other (multi)-modal logics the following
implications:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\MAY{a} \MAY{b} \models \MAY{a} 
 \qquad\qquad
\MAY{a} (\MAY{b} \land \MAY{c}) \models \MAY{a} \MAY{b}
\end{eqnarray*}
As \cathoristic{} is restricted to deterministic models, it also
validates the following formula:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\MAY{a} \MAY{b} \land \MAY{a} \MAY{b}  \models \MAY{a} (\MAY{b} \land \MAY{c})
\end{eqnarray*}
\Cathoristic{} also validates all implications in which the set of constraints is relaxed from left to right. For example:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\fBang \{c\} \models \fBang \{a, b, c\} 
 \qquad\qquad
\fBang \{\} \models \fBang \{a, b\} 
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{example}
